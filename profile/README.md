    <h3>The tool your support agents have drempt of...</h3>
    <p> ⚠️ Simple Support is in an active alpha stage, bugs will occur, please report them to us to ensure your experience is better ASAP!</p>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<p>
  One of the best open-source ticketing tools available for Discord.
  Support agents will never complain again when using our tool and will enjoy their role more!
  
  We may not be big, but our dreams are! We're open for suggestions and things to make us better, join our support Discord to suggest things!
</p>
<h2>Why should I not just go with a "better" popular ticketing bot?</h2>
<p>
  Although there may be more trusted and larger ticketing bots out there, Simple Support provides more features and nicer to work with standards, also did we mention that we offer premium features for free?!

 Simple Support doesn't believe in charging horribly large amounts just for support to be easy!
Our tool will allow your support agents to touch more grass and organise less!
